## 🛠️ Coding, Pick Your Weapon

Use AI coding agents to speed up your build. These all have **free tiers**:

| Tool | What It Is | Free? | Best For |
|------|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Google Antigravity** | Agent-first IDE by Google, describe a task, AI agents plan, code, test, and iterate for you. Built on VS Code, powered by Gemini 3 Pro. Has a Mission Control "Agent Manager" to run multiple agents in parallel. Also supports Claude Sonnet 4.5 & GPT-OSS. Mac/Win/Linux. | 100% free (public preview) | Rapid prototyping, vibe coding, "describe and ship" style building |
| **Claude Code** | Terminal-based AI agent by Anthropic | Free tier available | Deep reasoning, multi-file edits |
| **Cursor** | VS Code fork with built-in AI agent | Free tier | Full IDE experience, most popular among devs |
| **Cline** | Open-source AI coding agent (VS Code extension) | 100% free & open-source | Privacy-conscious devs, BYO API key |
| **GitHub Copilot** | AI pair programmer in your IDE | Free for students & open-source | Autocomplete + agent mode |
| **Windsurf** | AI-powered IDE (VS Code fork) | Free tier | Fast autocomplete + agent mode |
| **Replit** | Browser-based IDE + AI agent | Free tier | No setup needed, great for beginners |
| **Google AI Studio + Gemini** | Use Gemini models free in browser | Free | Quick prototyping, testing prompts |

**💡 Pro tip:** You don't have to pick one. Many devs use Cursor/Windsurf for the IDE and Claude Code for terminal tasks.

## 🤖 Free AI APIs, For Building AI Tools & Agents

If you're building something with AI (chatbot, agent, tool), you'll need an API. These have **generous free tiers**:

| Provider | Free Tier | Best For |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Google AI Studio (Gemini)** | Free, no credit card, ~1M tokens/day | Best overall free API, multimodal |
| **Groq** | Free, 14,400 req/day, blazing fast (300+ tokens/sec) | Speed-critical apps, chatbots |
| **OpenRouter** | Free access to 30+ models via single API | Experimenting with different models |
| **Hugging Face** | Free inference on 200k+ open-source models | NLP, embeddings, niche models |
| **Mistral AI** | Free, ~1B tokens/month | High-volume, open-source models |
| **Together AI** | $25 free credits on signup | Llama models, multimodal |
| **xAI (Grok)** | $25 free credits on signup | Real-time data from X/Twitter |
| **Cloudflare Workers AI** | 10,000 neurons/day free | Edge AI, serverless |
| **Anthropic (Claude)** | ~$5 free credits after phone verification | Best reasoning, long context |
| **OpenAI** | ~$5 free credits on signup | GPT models, image gen |

**💡 Pro tip:** Sign up for ALL of them. Use Gemini for prototyping, Groq for speed, and OpenRouter to compare models, you can stack $200+ in free credits.

## 📦 Code Management, GitHub It

- **GitHub**, Push your code, keep it open-source if possible. Your GitHub profile = your portfolio.
  - Create a new repo for each project
  - Write a clean README with screenshots/demo link
  - Use GitHub Pages for free static hosting
- **Git basics:** `git init` → `git add .` → `git commit -m "initial commit"` → `git push`

**💡 Pro tip:** Name your repos well. `ai-resume-builder` > `project1`. Recruiters will see these.

## 🚀 Deploy, Ship It Live

Your project isn't "shipped" until it has a URL. These are all **free** for personal/hobby projects:

| Platform | Best For | Free Tier |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Vercel** | Next.js, React, frontend apps | Free for personal projects |
| **Netlify** | Static sites, JAMstack, frontend | Free tier with 300 credits/month |
| **Cloudflare Pages** | Static sites, edge apps | Free, unlimited bandwidth |
| **Render** | Full-stack apps, APIs, backends | Free for static sites + small services |
| **Railway** | Full-stack apps + databases | $5 free credit/month |
| **GitHub Pages** | Static sites, portfolios | Completely free |
| **Replit** | Quick deploys from browser IDE | Free tier available |
| **Fly.io** | Docker apps, global deployment | Free for small apps |
| **Hugging Face Spaces** | AI/ML demos (Gradio, Streamlit) | Free for public spaces |
| **Streamlit Cloud** | Python data apps | Free for public repos |

**💡 Recommended flow:**
- Frontend/static site → **Vercel** or **Netlify** (connect GitHub, auto-deploys on push)
- Full-stack app → **Render** or **Railway**
- AI demo/tool → **Hugging Face Spaces** or **Streamlit Cloud**
- Just need a landing page → **GitHub Pages**

## 🎤 Share Your Work, Get Noticed

After you ship, share it! Don't just build in silence:

| Where | Why |
|-------|-----|
| **Twitter/X** | Tag #buildinpublic, share screenshots + demo links |
| **Reddit**, r/SideProject, r/webdev, r/MachineLearning | Great for honest feedback |
| **Hacker News**, "Show HN" | Dev-heavy audience, great for technical projects |
| **Product Hunt** | Classic launch platform for polished products |
| **Dev.to** | Write a blog post about what you built |
| **Indie Hackers** | Share your building journey, get community support |
| **LinkedIn** | Post about it, great for career visibility |
| **Peerlist** | Developer-focused showcase platform |
| **BetaList** | If you want early-adopter signups |
| **DevHunt** | Made for developer tools specifically |

**💡 Pro tip:** Write a short Twitter/LinkedIn post every weekend when you ship. "Week 1/6 of #SudoShipIt, Built X. Here's the demo → [link]". Consistency > perfection.
